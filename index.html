<h1>ALEKSEY YANOVICH</h1>
<p>Life can cause you much pain
<p>There are many ways to deal with this pain
<p>Choose wisely
<p>Will I fall? Will I fly?
<p>Heal my soul
<p>Fulfill my high
<p>Cross my heart (Count, count count, count it)
<p>And hope to die (Count, count count, count it)
<p>With my slice (Count, count, count, count it)
<p>Of Devil's pie
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>I know that it's difficult
<p>I'm stackin' the paper it's sorta habitual
<p>I blow the residual
<p>And f****n' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
<p>Pardon the visual
<p>But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
<p>I want it in physical
<p>A million dollars, I count up in intervals
<p>Without it I'm miserable
<p>Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
<p>Thankin' God like it's biblical
<p>I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
<p>I balled on the principal
<p>Remember the teachers that was all on my a**
<p>Now look all of them, pitiful
<p>And all of a sudden I'm so good at math
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Can't take it when you die
<p>Uno, dos, tres
<p>Big bills, big bills
<p>I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
<p>My n****s running tip drills, can't sit still
<p>Don't give a f**k if it kills, it mix well
<p>I'm only counting
<p>Big bills, big bills
<p>I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
<p>My n****s running tip drills, can't sit still
<p>Don't give a f**k if it kills, it mix well
<p>I'm only counting
<p>Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
<p>Proceed with caution
<p>I heard if you chase it only results in
<p>A hole in your heart
<p>F**k it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion
<p>It's only an organ
<p>Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
<p>The loneliest orphan
<p>I flipped my misfortune and grown me a fortune
<p>My Rollie is scorchin'
<p>Them n****s that hated is slowly endorsin'
<p>Now Cole, he important
<p>My n****s beside me like Tommy and Martin
<p>We ball in your court and
<p>Escape with your bitch like we turning your heart in
<p>She don't need no garments
<p>She h***y from all the money we countin'
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
<p>Can't take it when you die
<p>Uno dos
<p>Will I fall? Will I fly?
<p>Heal my soul
<p>Fulfill my high
<p>Cross my heart
<p>And hope to die
<p>With my slice of Devilâ€™s pie
<p>"Road Work Ahead", Yeah I Sure Hope It Does.

<p> And here is another paragraph.
Notice that spacing doesn't really matter.
Everything is printed on one line on the page.
Even though in the code, these are all seperate lines.
<p> If you want a new line, you need to use another paragraph tag.
<p>See.
